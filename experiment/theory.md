Shear strength of a soil is the maximum resistance to shearing stress at failure on the failure plane
Shear strength is composed of:
i. Internal friction which is the resistance due to friction between individual particles at their contact points and interlocking of particles. This interlocking strength is indicated through parameter Ď.
ii. Cohesion which resistance due to inter-particle force which tend hold the particles together in a soil mass. The indicative parameter is called Cohesion intercept (c).
The parameters c and are not constant for a given type of soil but depends in its degree of saturation, drainage conditions and the condition of laboratory testing.
In direct shear test, the sample is sheared along the horizontal plane. This indicates that the failure plane is horizontal. The normal stress, on this plane is the external vertical load divided by the corrected area of the soil sample. The shear stress at failure is the external lateral load divided by the corrected of soil sample.
